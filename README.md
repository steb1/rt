Certainly! Here's a README file that explains how to use the ray tracing program:

```markdown
# Ray Tracer

This is a simple ray tracing program that generates images of 3D scenes.

## Features

- Renders spheres, cubes, cylinders, and planes
- Supports multiple light sources
- Generates images in PPM format
- Customizable camera and object positions

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, typically installed with Rust)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://learn.zone01dakar.sn/git/lomalack/rt.git
   cd ray-tracer
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

Run the program using:

```
cargo run --release
```

This will generate four PPM images:

1. `sphere_scene.ppm`: A scene with a single sphere
2. `plane_cube_scene.ppm`: A scene with a plane and a cube
3. `all_objects_scene.ppm`: A scene with one of each object type (sphere, cube, cylinder, and plane)
4. `all_objects_different_perspective.ppm`: The same scene as (3), but from a different camera angle

## Customizing the Scenes

You can modify the `main.rs` file to adjust the scenes:

- Change object positions, sizes, and properties
- Adjust camera positions and properties
- Modify light source positions and intensities

After making changes, rebuild and run the program as described above.

## Viewing the Output

PPM files are not widely supported by default image viewers. You can use these methods to view the output:

1. Use a PPM-compatible image viewer like GIMP or IrfanView
2. Convert PPM to a more common format using ImageMagick:
   ```
   convert input.ppm output.png
   ```
